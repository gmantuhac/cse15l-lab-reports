# Lab Report 1

Hello! Welcome to Lab Report 1. This report will be based for Windows users. Sorry for those who use MacOS.

## Step 1. Installing VSCode

Visit the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website and click the blue button saying **Download for Windows**. Once VSCode has downloaded, open VSCode up and a window displaying the software should open up.

## Step 2. Remotely Connecting

First we need to look up our [account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) for CSE15L. If this is your first time logging into your account, just say yes to the prompt the terminal gives and input your password (Password shoudl look invisible since the system is very secure). Your terminal should look something similar to this:

## Step 3. Running Commands

We will now run some commands on both your computer and the computer we have ssh'd in. Some of these commands are:

* `cd ~`
* `cd`
* `ls`
* `ls -lat`
* `ls -a`

Try these on your own and see how it compares between the two terminals.
